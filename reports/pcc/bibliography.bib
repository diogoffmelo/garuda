  Abstract                 = {Optical Burst Switching (OBS) is the future of optical internet which provides a promising architecture to efficiently utilize WDM and to fulfill todays Internet traffic demands. Since this area is yet to mature there is a darn need to study its various protocols. Network simulator is an important tool for researchers and academicians to simulate and model the actual network at a reduced cost compared to the real test-bed experimentation. In this paper various OBS simulators are comparatively surveyed, while highlighting their merits and demerits.},

  Abstract                 = {In a cell or microorganism, the processes that generate mass, energy, information transfer and cell-fate specification are seamlessly integrated through a complex network of cellular constituents and reactions. However, despite the key role of these networks in sustaining cellular functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Here we present a systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variation in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.},

  Abstract                 = {Todays optical networks function are in a fairly static fashion and are built to operate within well-defined specifications. This scenario is quite challenging for next generation high-capacity systems, since network paths are not static and channel-degrading effects can change with temperature, component drift, aging, fiber plant maintenance and many other factors. Moreover, we are far from being able to simply plug-and-play an optical node into an existing network in such a way that the network itself can allocate resources to ensure error-free transmission. Optical performance monitoring could potentially enable higher stability, reconfigurability, and flexibility in a self-managed optical network. This paper will describe the specific fiber impairments that future intelligent optical network might want to monitor as well as some promising techniques. },

  Abstract                 = {We studied the efficiency of different implementations of the split-step Fourier method for solving the nonlinear Schr\&ouml;dinger equation that employ different step-size selection criteria. We compared the performance of the different implementations for a variety of pulse formats and systems,including higher order solitons, collisions of soliton pulses, a single-channel periodically stationary dispersion-managed soliton system, and chirped return to zero systems with single and multiple channels. We introduce a globally third-order accurate split-step scheme, in which a bound on the local error is used to select the step size. In many cases, this method is the most efficient when compared with commonly used step-size selection criteria, and it is robust for a wide range of systems providing a system-independent rule for choosing the step sizes. We find that a step-size selection method based on limiting the nonlinear phase rotation of each step is not efficient for many optical-fiber transmission systems, although it works well for solitons. We also tested a method that uses a logarithmic step-size distribution to bound the amount of spurious four-wave mixing. This method is as efficient as other second-order schemes in the single-channel dispersion-managed soliton system, while it is not efficient in other cases including multichannel simulations. We find that in most cases, the simple approach in which the step size is held constant is the least efficient of all the methods. Finally, we implemented a method in which the step size is inversely proportional to the largest group velocity difference between channels. This scheme performs best in multichannel optical communications systems for the values of accuracy typically required in most transmission simulations.},
